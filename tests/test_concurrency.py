"""Concurrency / GIL-release regression test.

AIDEV-NOTE: `repo.odb.read` releases the GIL via `allow_threads` around grit-lib's
decompress + hash-verify (see src/odb.rs). This test runs many concurrent reads of
the SAME oid across 8 threads to prove the binding's concurrency model is sound:
the shared `Arc<Repository>` / `Arc<Mutex<..>>` odb must not deadlock, crash, or
return corrupt data under contention. It asserts CORRECTNESS only — there is NO
timing/speedup assertion (that would be flaky and environment-sensitive). If this
ever deadlocks or crashes, FIX the binding, do not weaken the test.
